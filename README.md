# Hash-Length-Extension-Attack
Implementation of the Hash length extension attack in Python

In cryptography and computer security, a length extension attack is a type of attack where an attacker can use Hash(message1) and the length of message1 to calculate Hash(message1 ‖ message2) for an attacker-controlled message2, without needing to know the content of message1. Algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 that are based on the Merkle–Damgard construction are susceptible to this kind of attack. The SHA-3 algorithm is not susceptible.

When a Merkle–Damgard based hash is misused as a message authentication code with construction H(secret ‖ message), and message and the length of secret is known, a length extension attack allows anyone to include extra information at the end of the message and produce a valid hash without knowing the secret.
This is the mechanism we use here.

The vulnerable hashing functions work by taking the input message, and using it to transform an internal state. After all of the input has been processed, the hash digest is generated by outputting the internal state of the function. It is possible to reconstruct the internal state from the hash digest, which can then be used to process the new data. In this way, one may extend the message and compute the hash that is a valid signature for the new message.
